Drunk girls
Drunk girls 
Drunk girls 
Drunk girls 

(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls cause a couple of heart attacks
(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls are unusually mild
(Drunk boys)
Drunk boys keep in pace with the pedophiles
(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls are boringly wild

(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls get invitations from nations
(Drunk girls)
They got the patience of a million saints
(Drunk boys)
They steal, they steal from the cupboards
(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls like to file complaints

(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls are like a night of simplicity
(Drunk girls)
They need a lover who is smarter than me
(Drunk boys)
